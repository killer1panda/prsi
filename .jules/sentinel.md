## 2026-09-04 - Timing Attack Vulnerability in API Key Verification
**Vulnerability:** The API key validation in `verify_api_key` (`api_v2_production.py`) compared the provided credentials against valid keys using the `in` operator (list membership check), which uses standard string comparison. Standard string comparison short-circuits on the first differing character, creating a timing side-channel that could allow an attacker to guess the API key character-by-character.
**Learning:** Even simple string comparisons for secrets (like `api_key in valid_keys` or `api_key == valid_key`) can expose the application to timing attacks. This is a common pattern when developers manually validate secrets without using established cryptographic functions.
**Prevention:** Always use `secrets.compare_digest(a, b)` for comparing sensitive strings like passwords, API keys, or tokens. This function compares strings in constant time, eliminating the timing side-channel.

## 2025-03-09 - Hardcoded Twitter Credentials in Multiple Scrapers
**Vulnerability:** Found multiple scraper scripts (selenium_login.py, run_twitter_scraper.py, playwright_login.py, playwright_login_v2.py, uc_login.py) that contained hardcoded plain-text developer credentials for Twitter (email, username, password) which would be exposed in the repository.
**Learning:** Hardcoded credentials are often copied across multiple similar scripts as different approaches are attempted (e.g., trying different scraping tools like Selenium, Playwright, or Twikit). Finding one hardcoded secret likely means others exist in sibling scripts.
**Prevention:** All scripts, even one-off helper or test scripts, should retrieve credentials using environment variables (`os.environ.get()` or a centralized config manager) instead of hardcoding them. Establish a pre-commit hook to scan for sensitive tokens.
## 2024-05-24 - Hardcoded Neo4j Password
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded Neo4j password ("doom_index_prod_2026") was present in production scripts and test configurations.
**Learning:** Hardcoding credentials in source code or documentation exposes sensitive systems to unauthorized access if the codebase is compromised. Even if used as a fallback or in tests, it risks accidental deployment to production.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables for sensitive credentials. Ensure tests and local development scripts rely on `.env` files or system environment variables rather than hardcoded fallbacks.
